algorithms-java
===============
This repository contains:
- Common Algorithms that were implemented using Java
- Solutions to a lot of interview questions

Graph Algorithms & Solutions:
- Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
- Algorithm that solves the max-spacing k clustering problem: "Given a distance measure d and k, compute the k-clustering with maximum spacing"
- Algorithm that solves the interview question: "Design an efficient algorithm that takes as input a collection of equality and 
inequality constraints and decides whether the constraints can be satisfied simultaneously."
